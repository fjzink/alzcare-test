# Alzcare Coding Challenge
This is my React/Redux app that integrates the flickr API to allow you to search photos from the public feed based on tags. The app is bundled with Webpack, and is set up for css modules and SASS.

## Usage

#### Instructions for local installation:

Clone the repo to your local machine. 


```
git clone https://github.com/fjzink/alzcare-test.git
```


Install the dependencies with your package manager of choice.


```
yarn install
```


There are scripts to run the development server and to create an optimized production build. 


To start the development server run the `dev` script:

```
yarn dev
```

To create a production build of the react app run the `build` script:

```
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder in the root directory of the project if it does not already exist and output your bundled project files into this folder.

## Deployed app
The app is deployed to heroku at:
